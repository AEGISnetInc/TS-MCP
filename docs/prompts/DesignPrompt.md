# MCP for Touchstone (TS-MCP)

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SKILLS: Use superpowers skills to write and implement all plans resulting from this prompt.

## Background

AEGIS.net, Inc. has a FHIR testing platform called Touchstone (https://touchstone.com). It is available as a SaaS subscription. Please familiarize your self with Touchstone, then read these proposals for creating an MCP server and associated services for using that MCP server with Touchstone: `docs/prompts/Integrating AEGIS Touchstone with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).md` and `docs/prompts/Touchstone-MCP Integration_ Use Case Analysis.md`.

Based on the context gained by analyzing that content, launch a brainstorming session with me to develop a recommended design for implementing Use Case 1.
